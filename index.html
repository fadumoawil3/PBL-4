            <h1> Hello! I'm Faduma...</h1>
            <p> I'm 17 years old, a junior at Horizon Science Academy Columbus Highschool. My pathway is Programming/Computer Science/Cybersecurity. I also plan on majoring in Computer Science in College. Currently, I am working towards completeing my AS degree in Computer and Information Sciences at Columbus State Community College by the time I finish highschool. After that, I plan on transfering to Ohio State University to complete my bachelors in Computer Science, and possibly double major in business or marketing. Currently, I am focussed on learning more programming languages and types of programming such as game development, databases, Java, Javascript, Python, etc. I am also interested in finding or working with companies and organizations in my field to gain real world experience and expand my skills, I currently have a few internships lined up to work towards that goal of mind. </p>
